		<p>My name is <b style="color:red; font-size:25px">Ernesto Murillo</b>. I go by <strong>Ernie</strong>. I was born and raised in Providence, RI. I also previously lived in California for ten years. 
		I have been back in RI for the last five and a half years. I also have two kids as well.  Gabriela who is thirteen and Brandon who is eleven.  
		When I decided to continue my education, I wanted to do it in the fastest time possible. I liked what <em>NEIT</em> had to offer. 
		I loved working with computers and also wanted to learn programming. I started <em>NEIT</em> and am in my third quarter.  My tech is <i style="color:blue; font-size:20px">Computer Software Engineering</i>. 
		I chose Software Engineering because I can go work in any field that I choose including gaming. I am currently enrolled for the Bachelors and will probably go for the Masters. 
		My dream job would be working for Blizzard Entertainment or Google. </p>
