Final Part 3

Campaign Website - Part 3
For this assignment you will use HTML and CSS to create a template for your home page design. When we start to develop sites we generally begin with implementing the visual design to HTML and CSS for the home page of the site.
Before you code and work on other pages it is good to make sure the main site structure and styling works for the home page. We will eventually use this page to create the other page templates.
DO NOT CODE ANY OTHER PAGES EXCEPT THE HOME PAGE!
Directions
Slice out necessary images from your Photoshop Design to be used in the HTML document
Use the Photoshop "eye-dropper" tool to get RGB or HEX color information for background colors and text colors.
Write down and document the fonts used.
Create a div based main structure for your HTML page
Entire page must center in the browser
Use  "floating" positioning for the main skeletal elements
Use one external CSS file
Incorporate "semantic" elements where they make sense
Use Headings for titles and sub-titles
Comment both your HTML and CSS files
Use "alt" and "title" tags on in-line images
Create roll-over's for main navigation buttons


Final Part 4

Campaign Website - Part 4
Once you've coded your home page (and it displays the way you want and error free) then it's time to start creating other pages for the site. Since the home page is a "jumping" point to other content, it would be good to reuse as many elements and styles that we can from it.
Elements we can reuse are:
The container/wrapper that centers the site in the browser
The Header (Which has a name or logo)
Main Navigation
The Footer
Start with making a copy of the index.html and rename it a page you're going to have in the site. You can now delete and modify the content areas of the framework to the new page's content topic. You can even add divs and other elements and add styles in the CSS.
Directions:
For this week we are going to build the:
Bio page (bio.html)
Events page (events.html)
Issue (issues.html)
Video Page (video.html)
Contact (contact.html)
All these pages should be accessible from the home page navigation!

Populate content for the pages:
Bio
Issues
Events
Video
( We will do the contact page last)
