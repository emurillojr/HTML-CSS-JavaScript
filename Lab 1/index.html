<h1>Ernesto Murillo - About Me</h1>
<!-- Hearder 1 - Name and About Me -->

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>My name is <b>Ernesto Murillo</b>. I go by <strong>Ernie</strong>. I was born and raised in Providence, RI. I also previously lived in California for ten years. 
I have been back in RI for the last five and a half years. I also have two kids as well.  Gabriela who is thirteen and Brandon who is eleven.  
When I decided to continue my education, I wanted to do it in the fastest time possible. I liked what <em>NEIT</em> had to offer. 
I loved working with computers and also wanted to learn programming. I started <em>NEIT</em> and am in my third quarter.  My tech is <i>Computer Software Engineering</i>. 
I chose Software Engineering because I can go work in any field that I choose including gaming. I am currently enrolled for the Bachelors and will probably go for the Masters. 
My dream job would be working for Blizzard Entertainment or Google. </p>
